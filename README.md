# sediment_sequences
Overview

This repository contains raw 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data obtained from bacterial communities in mangrove sediments collected from Isla del Carmen Campeche, Mexico. The data is part of a study aimed at understanding the diversity and composition of bacterial communities in mangrove ecosystems in southern Gulf of Mexico.
